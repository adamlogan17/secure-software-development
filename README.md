# secure-software-development

Within this repository you can find the 3 assignments that I produced within this module.

## Lab Reports

### Lab 01 - Buffer Overflow

This was the first lab report that was produced for this module and consisted of analysing a given executable file.

### Lab 02 - SQLi

In this second lab report, the option was given to choose the 'box', in which to analyse. I had chosen the 'Appointment' box from 'Hack the Box'.

You can find the report either in the folder or at this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ToDOXwxzOPtnL2iMGjKrkQoOEIwfLZOV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103168906336398527104&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Lab 03 - Threat Modelling

The third report is a threat model for a bar and restaurant service application.

You can find the report either in the folder or at this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kv2V4cniK5j9EY0oADmO-JgHj1cZTYxv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103168906336398527104&rtpof=true&sd=true)
