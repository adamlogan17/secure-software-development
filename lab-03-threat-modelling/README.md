# lab-03-threat-modelling

## Summary

This report is a threat model on a bar and restaurant service application. We were first split into teams to design the application to be modelled and then the teams were split to perform the threat model ourselves. You can also view the report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kv2V4cniK5j9EY0oADmO-JgHj1cZTYxv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103168906336398527104&rtpof=true&sd=true) and the design documentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kxxc-lUXk5XfgPHh1lWnwHDoUD1ALj6W/view?usp=sharing)
